    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We've all been there. If you haven't been there yet there will come a day when you really don't have the energy to make a good meal. However, you know you can't just eat instant noodles and hope for the best. You do still need to have some nourishment.</p>
    <p><em>Fancifying</em> your instant noodles is nothing new. People do it all the time. This recipe is just how I do it to maximize the laziness, keep it cheap, keep it flavorful, and keep myself nourished.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1â€‰pack of instant noodles. (I've found I really enjoy indomie instant fried noodles)</li>
        <li>1 Green onion stalk chopped</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 small can of chicken</li>
        <li>1 small can of bean sprouts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil some water on the stove with an egg in it. I typically soft boil my egg which takes around 5 - 6 minutes. Otherwise, consult the internet for your boiling time.</li>
        <li>While your egg is boiling you can follow the instructions on your noodles to combine sauces and seasonings in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Remove egg from boiling water and place in a ice bath. Make sure to crack the egg in the cold water as much as possible to avoid the shell pulling peices of the egg white off.</li>
        <li>Add your noodle block, bean sprouts, and canned chicken to the boiling water and cook for recommended noodle boil time. Typically 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>While your ingredients cook you can deshell your egg.</li>
        <li>Once the noodles and others are done you can strain them and add them to your seasonings.</li>
        <li>Cut egg in half and lay ontop of your noodle bed.</li>
        <li>Garnish with your green onion.</li>
    </ol>
