    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken salad, contrary to what you may believe, is in no way a salad. Chicken salad is a perfect blend of savory and sometimes sweet ingredients with a mayonnaise base. The main ingredient being chicken and any other ingredients being what you end up deciding you would like.</p>
    <p>Chicken salad is a robust dish in that you can keep it as simple as you like or make it as complicated as your heart desires. As simple as it comes you really only need mayo and chicken. However, people rarely eat it like that. Most likely you'll want some garlic and onion in there for flavor. Pepper and mustard couldn't hurt. From there you could add cellery, nuts, raisins or more. Regardless, I'll leave my favorite recipe below.</p>

        <li>1 Diced Onion</li>
        <li>3 Teaspoons of Garlic Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
