    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nothing beats having a sweet apple crumble. It's a great dish that is beloved by many. If you'd like to have a little fun with it I say add icecream. Hot, cold, and sweet? Now that is a triple threat!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 large Cortland apples - peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter, cubed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread apples in an even layer in a deep dish pie plate or 8-inch square glass casserole dish. Cover with white sugar, then top with cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and brown sugar for topping in a bowl. Add butter and cut in with a pastry blender. Spread topping evenly over apple mixture and pat down.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until apple mixture is bubbling and topping is browned, about 55 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
